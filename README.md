# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Mastery

Welcome to my central repository for algorithm practice and project development. This repo serves as a technical log of my journey through computer science fundamentals, organized by language-specific branches.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Projects

I use specific branches to maintain a clean environment for each language. Below are the primary languages I use and the featured projects housed within each.

**Branch:** `cpp-branch`

- **Focus:** Low-level memory management and high-performance algorithms.
- **Featured Project:** \* **Hangman Game:** A CLI-based interactive game focusing on string manipulation and game logic.
  - _DSA focus:_ STL (Standard Template Library), Pointers, and Recursion.

**Branch:** `java-branch`

- **Focus:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Enterprise-grade structure.
- **Featured Project:** \* **Electricity Bill Generator:** A system designed to calculate utility costs using class inheritance and file handling.
  - _DSA focus:_ Collections Framework, Trees, and Graphs.

**Branch:** `python-branch`

- **Focus:** Rapid prototyping and clean, readable implementation.
- **Featured Project:** \* **Tic-Tac-Toe Game:** A logic-based game implementing basic AI/Minimax principles.
  - _DSA focus:_ Dynamic Programming, Hashing, and Scripting.

## 📈 Branching Strategy

To keep the `main` branch clean and professional, I follow a **feature-branch workflow**:

1.  **Development:** All coding happens in language-specific branches.
2.  **Daily Sync:** Changes are merged into `main` via Pull Requests at the end of each session.
3.  **Portfolio View:** The `main` branch acts as a complete archive of all solved problems and projects.
